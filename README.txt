Hi!
This is my very first "project". 
In this simple exercise I've done, I tried to write a couple of test scenarios, test cases, bug reports and summary report.
The application I've tested was MrBuggy 3. This is Polish application created for competition for testers. 
Due to lack of documents, most of my work was based on exploratory testing.
In first sheet you can find Specification Review (based on document!).
In second sheet you can find Interface Testing (based on document!).
Next sheet contains test scenarios for 7 tasks from MrBuggy 3 client. These have not any documentation.
Next sheets are test cases.
Last sheet is summary report. My histogram and diagram was done in Python using matplotlib package. I hope you can see my code I've used to build these.
Because I worked alone and these are "unrepairable" defects, I didn't make any metric about bugs status.
